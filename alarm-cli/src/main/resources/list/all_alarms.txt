Subsystem: TCS
Component: tcsPk
Name: cpuExceededAlarm
Description: This alarm is activated when the tcsPk Assembly can no longer calculate all of its pointing values in the time allocated. The CPU may lock power, or there may be pointing loops running that are not needed. Response: Check to see if pointing loops are executing that are not needed or see about a more powerful CPU.
